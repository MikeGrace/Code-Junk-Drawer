Selenium Python Web Scraper
========================

Simple install and test scripts for getting started in building your own python powered 
Selenium web scraper. This is powerful because just doing a curl gets the raw source of 
the web page while this allows a browser to run javascript and return the resulting page.
It's also nice to be able to take screenshots. This can be used for more than scraping 
the web but that's what prompted this excursion.

STEPS

1. Have ubuntu 10.04 server that you are logged into with ability to sudo
2. Have curl installed `sudo apt-get install curl`
3. Download install script `curl https://raw.github.com/MikeGrace/Code-Junk-Drawer/master/ubuntu-install-scripts/python-selenium-take-screenshot-and-save-source-to-file/install.sh > install.sh`
4. Make it executable `chmod +x install.sh`
5. Run it `sudo ./install.sh`

Copy it!

    sudo apt-get install curl
    
    curl https://raw.github.com/MikeGrace/Code-Junk-Drawer/master/ubuntu-install-scripts/python-selenium-take-screenshot-and-save-source-to-file/install.sh > install.sh
    chmod +x install.sh
    sudo ./install.sh
